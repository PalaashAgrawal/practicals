  <article class="markdown"><h1 id="practical-machine-learning">Practical Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Welcome to Practical Machine Learning, a code-first course to learn the practical side of Machine Learning. Here you will learn how to build and run your own Machine Learning models in python. More importantly you will learn practical tips and tricks in Machine Learning and Software Development, which traditionally comes through years and years of experience, and so, this course offers you an opportunity to grow much faster. Every session is designed to help you build <strong>state-of-the-art</strong> models, and learn how to tackle real-life situations like industrial experts.</p>

    <h2 id="whats-unique-about-this-course">What&rsquo;s unique about this course?</h2>
<p>There are great resources out there to learn concepts in Machine Learning, there arenâ€™t many resources to learn how to code. This mini-course teaches cocepts in Machine Learning through code. No unnecessary theory and little to no math needed. No advanced coding skills required. This is a great resource to learn how to build your own models in python, and how to use already existing libraries to the best of your advantage!

  <div class="flex-even markdown-inner">
    <h2 id="who-is-this-course-for">Who is this course for?</h2>
<p>There are no prerequisites to this course as such. But it is reccommended to have a basic understanding of a concept before learning how to implement it through code.  But anyone who decides to start their journies in Machine Learning through this course are more than welcome to do so. The only other requirement in that case is a commitment to put in extra effort.

<h2 id="how-should-i-go-about-this-course">How should I go about this course?</h2>
<p>The best way to go about this course is to do this in parallel with another theory inclusive course in Machine Learning. It may be a course in your university, or an online MOOC. Once you have a basic understanding of the concept (meaning, you have an intuition about how it works, and know the working (without the math and the overly technical details), come back here and pick the corresponding session. Run all the code sequentially (Type them, don&rsquo;t copy paste!), and try solving the exercise provided at the last. Once you do that, its recommended to go through the entire session again, and this time try writing all the code on your own, without looking. If you get stuck, its okay to take a peek into the original code, and then continue writing without looking. The idea is to understand the steps involved, and to gain the confidence to code independently.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-expect-to-learn-from-this-course">What can I expect to learn from this course?</h2>
<p>The focus of this course is to learn how to build your own Machine Learning models, and solve different kinds of problems through those models. So, besides learning how to implement the code for the model, you will learn how to pick up a problem of any complexity, tackling each challenge that comes along the way, and formatting the problem in a way that can be solved by your Machine Learning model. This is going to give you the confidence to face the challenges that you will face when you come across real life problems. Another focus of this course is to gain good coding skills. Throughout this course, we will focus on good coding practices, like using advanced python tools, using library APIs in a structural manner, refactoring code, and working in an object oriented programming manner. Finally, you will learn the State-of-the-Art tools and techniques used in the industry, and beyond!</p>
<h2 id="setup-instructions">Setup Instructions</h2>
<p>This course uses a jupyter notebook-style environment. This is because jupyter notebooks are a really flexible way to make a holisitic development environment. A single notebook can contain code, text, pictures, video embeddings, etc, in any order. This makes it really intuitive to understand concepts through code.</p>
<p>You can either run You can use one of the following environments:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#setting-up-cloud-based-jupyter-notebooks">Setting up cloud based jupyter notebooks</a> (<em>Reccommended</em>)</li>
<li><a href="#setting-up-jupyter-notebooks-on-your-local-system">Setting up jupyter notebooks on your local system</a></li>
<li><a href="#cloning-the-github-repo">Cloning the GitHub repo</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The solutions of the exercise notebooks are provided in the (GitHub repo)</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-cloud-based-jupyter-notebooks">Setting up Cloud based Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
<p>You can set up any cloud based system that supports Jupyter Notebooks, like <em>GCP</em>, <em>PaperSpace</em>, <em>Kaggle</em>, <em>Google Colab</em>, etc.</p>
<p>In this course, we reccommend <em>Google Colab</em>. Google Colaboratory (called <em>Colab</em> for short) is a jupyter environment from Google, and easily integrates with all other google services. For example, you can easily integrate it with Google Drive, or share the notebook with other people. Google Colab is a convenient way to run ipynb notebooks with minimal setup. You don&rsquo;t need to install most commonly-used python libraries. You need to have a google account for this.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-google-colab">Setting up Google Colab</h3>
<p>The simplest and most organised way to set up a Colab notebook is to login to your Google Drive. You can optionally make a folder at a suitable location if you wish to organise all your Colab Notebooks in a specific folder. Once you navigate to a folder of your choice, simply create a new colab notebook, by clicking on <em>New &ndash;&gt; More &ndash;&gt;Google Colaboratory</em>. This will open a new colab notebook on the website <em>colab.research.google.com</em>.</p>
<p>Give your notebook a suitable name by clicking on the title at the top (for example, <em>01 Basics of Python and ML.ipynb</em>)(Note that jupyter notebooks have an extension of <em>.ipynb</em>). The instructions to use this notebook are described in <a href="https://palaashagrawal.github.io/practicals/docs/00-basics-of-python-and-introduction-to-machine-learning/">01 Basics of Python and Introduction to Machine Learning</a>. Whenever you wish to run a piece of code, you simply type the code in a <em>cell</em> and run it.</p>
<p>The notebook is auto-saved, so you don&rsquo;t have to do it manually. Whenever you wish to return to the notebook, simply go back to your Google Drive directory, and double click on the Notebook, and then click on <em>Open With &ndash;&gt; Google Colaboratory</em>.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-jupyter-notebooks-on-your-local-system">Setting up Jupyter Notebooks on your local system</h2>
<p>You can find a detailed, step-by-step guide <a href="https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">here</a>. Once you open a Jupyter Notebook, the same instructions that are described above in the Colab section are followed! However, you might need to install libraries whenever you use them for the first time. You can do this by following <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/install-python-package-using-jupyter-notebook/">this</a> guide.</p>
<h2 id="cloning-the-github-repo">Cloning the Github Repo</h2>
<p>Though there is no substitute to typing your own code, there is a minor setback - You won&rsquo;t get the descriptions, pictures, gifs, etc that you see on the blog (Jupyter Notebooks allow you to do that!), unless you explicitly type everything manually. If you feel that you need all the pictures and descriptions along with the code for better understanding, or for future references, you can use pre-written <em>.ipynb</em> file, that are present in the <a href="https://github.com/PalaashAgrawal/Practical-Machine-Learning-Sessions">GitHub Repo</a>. If you use a terminal like the Windows Command Line, Linux Based Bash system, or Mac Terminal, you can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">clone</a> the repo on your local system and upload the notebooks to your google drive to a preferred directory. In case you don&rsquo;t use a terminal, downloading a zip folder of the repository directly would be a better option. You can simply do so by going to the GitHub reposi*tory, click on the green button that says <em>Code</em>, and click on download zip. Unzip the downloaded folder and upload the <em>.ipynb</em> files to your Google Drive (if you want to use Google Colab), or directly open the .ipynb files using the jupyter system installed on your local system.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-author-and-the-course">About the Author and the Course</h2>
<p>My name is Palaash Agrawal. All these tutorials have been developed by me. Read more about me <a href="https://palaashagrawal.github.io/about">here</a>.</p>
<p>This course is heavily inspired by Jeremy Howard&rsquo;s growing community <em>fast.ai</em>, which believes in a top-down approach of learning philosophy. <em>fastai</em> focuses on Deep Learning, but I felt there was a lack of courses that followed a similar top-down approach for general Machine Learning. So this course was created as an endeavour to fill that gap. Obviously this course is not exhaustive, and your journey in practical Machine Learning only starts from here. If you have suggestions or feedback, you can contact me through <a href="https://palaashagrawal.github.io/contact">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="note-for-the-user">Note for the user</h2>
<p>This course is still being developed. You can expect a new tutorial each week.</p>
