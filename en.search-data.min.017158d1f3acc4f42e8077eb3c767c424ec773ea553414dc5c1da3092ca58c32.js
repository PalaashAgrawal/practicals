I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with \u0026ldquo;INFO:\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that\u0026rsquo;s the place to start. For now, though, let\u0026rsquo;s just confirm that we have what we\u0026rsquo;d expect from a site with no content.\n$ ls -l public total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 416 Sep 29 17:02 index.xml -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 262 Sep 29 17:02 sitemap.xml $ Hugo created two XML files, which is standard, but there are no HTML files.\nTest the New Site Verify that you can run the built-in web server. It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

This is the file public/index.html. Hugo created a css/ directory. Hugo created a js/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.  The Home Page Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 ./public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 ./themes/zafta/layouts/index.html $ The Magic of Static Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ The Theme Development Cycle When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\n Purge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4.  I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload. As pages are saved on the server, the browser is told to refresh the page. Usually, this happens faster than you can say, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s totally amazing.\u0026rdquo;\nDevelopment Commands Use the following commands as the basis for your workflow.\n## purge old files. hugo will recreate the public directory. ## $ rm -rf public ## ## run hugo in watch mode ## $ hugo server --watch --verbose Here\u0026rsquo;s sample output showing Hugo detecting a change to the template for the home page. Once generated, the web browser automatically reloaded the page. I\u0026rsquo;ve said this before, it\u0026rsquo;s amazing.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo server --watch --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Watching for changes in /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/content Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop INFO: 2014/09/29 File System Event: [\u0026quot;/Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/layouts/index.html\u0026quot;: MODIFY|ATTRIB] Change detected, rebuilding site WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 1 ms Update the Home Page Template The home page is one of a few special pages that Hugo creates automatically.

That\u0026rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule (in fact, we\u0026rsquo;ll break it a few times in this tutorial), but it is a good generalization.\nMake a Static Home Page Right now, that page is empty because we don\u0026rsquo;t have any content and we don\u0026rsquo;t have any logic in the template.

I mean let\u0026rsquo;s have the home page automatically reflect the content in the site every time Hugo builds it. We\u0026rsquo;ll use iteration in the template to do that.\nCreate New Posts Now that we have the home page generating static content, let\u0026rsquo;s add some content to the site. We\u0026rsquo;ll display these posts as a list on the home page and on their own page, too.\nHugo has a command to generate a skeleton post, just like it does for sites and themes.\n$ hugo --verbose new post/first.md INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 attempting to create post/first.md of post INFO: 2014/09/29 curpath: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md ERROR: 2014/09/29 Unable to Cast \u0026lt;nil\u0026gt; to map[string]interface{} $ That wasn\u0026rsquo;t very nice, was it?\nThe \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command uses an archetype to create the post file.

The homepage doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.\nList and Single Templates In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026quot;. In our template, the commands are:\n range .Title end  The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page.

Hugo lets \u0026ldquo;slug\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;URL\u0026rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.\nSharing Templates If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put the title in the home page\u0026rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at a different option.\nWe can put the common bits into a shared template that\u0026rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.\nCreate the Header and Footer Partials In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme\u0026rsquo;s presentation.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; :wq $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:\n{{ template \u0026quot;theme/partials/header.html\u0026quot; . }} versus\n{{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} Both pass in the context.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;) (eq .Type \u0026quot;about\u0026quot;) }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results.

The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.\nAdd “Date Published” to Posts It\u0026rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let\u0026rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named \u0026ldquo;date.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\u0026rsquo;s the value we want to display.\nAdd “Date Published” to the Template We\u0026rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There\u0026rsquo;s a problem, though. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page also has the date displayed.\nAs usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/','title':"Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll",'section':"Blog",'content':"Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like\n▾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become\n▾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you\u0026rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.\nCreate your Hugo configuration file Hugo can read your configuration as JSON, YAML or TOML. Hugo supports parameters custom configuration too. Refer to the Hugo configuration documentation for details.\nSet your configuration publish folder to _site The default is for Jekyll to publish to _site and for Hugo to publish to public. If, like me, you have _site mapped to a git submodule on the gh-pages branch, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to do one of two alternatives:\n  Change your submodule to point to map gh-pages to public instead of _site (recommended).\n git submodule deinit _site git rm _site git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public    Or, change the Hugo configuration to use _site instead of public.\n { .. \u0026quot;publishdir\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;_site\u0026quot;, .. }    Convert Jekyll templates to Hugo templates That\u0026rsquo;s the bulk of the work right here. The documentation is your friend. You should refer to Jekyll\u0026rsquo;s template documentation if you need to refresh your memory on how you built your blog and Hugo\u0026rsquo;s template to learn Hugo\u0026rsquo;s way.\nAs a single reference data point, converting my templates for heyitsalex.net took me no more than a few hours.\nConvert Jekyll plugins to Hugo shortcodes Jekyll has plugins; Hugo has shortcodes. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly trivial to do a port.\nImplementation As an example, I was using a custom image_tag plugin to generate figures with caption when running Jekyll. As I read about shortcodes, I found Hugo had a nice built-in shortcode that does exactly the same thing.\nJekyll\u0026rsquo;s plugin:\nmodule Jekyll class ImageTag \u0026lt; Liquid::Tag @url = nil @caption = nil @class = nil @link = nil // Patterns IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION = IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION_AND_LINK = /(\\w+)(\\s+)((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))(\\s+)\u0026quot;(.*?)\u0026quot;(\\s+)-\u0026gt;((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))(\\s*)/i IMAGE_URL_WITH_CAPTION = /((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))(\\s+)\u0026quot;(.*?)\u0026quot;/i IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS = /(\\w+)(\\s+)((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))/i IMAGE_URL = /((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))/i def initialize(tag_name, markup, tokens) super if markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION_AND_LINK @class = $1 @url = $3 @caption = $7 @link = $9 elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION @class = $1 @url = $3 @caption = $7 elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CAPTION @url = $1 @caption = $5 elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS @class = $1 @url = $3 elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL @url = $1 end end def render(context) if @class source = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;figure class='#{@class}'\u0026gt;\u0026quot; else source = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;figure\u0026gt;\u0026quot; end if @link source += \u0026quot;\u0026lt;a href=\\\u0026quot;#{@link}\\\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot; end source += \u0026quot;\u0026lt;img src=\\\u0026quot;#{@url}\\\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot; if @link source += \u0026quot;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026quot; end source += \u0026quot;\u0026lt;figcaption\u0026gt;#{@caption}\u0026lt;/figcaption\u0026gt;\u0026quot; if @caption source += \u0026quot;\u0026lt;/figure\u0026gt;\u0026quot; source end end end Liquid::Template.register_tag('image', Jekyll::ImageTag)  is written as this Hugo shortcode:\n\u0026lt;!-- image --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;figure {{ with .Get \u0026quot;class\u0026quot; }}class=\u0026quot;{{.}}\u0026quot;{{ end }}\u0026gt; {{ with .Get \u0026quot;link\u0026quot;}}\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{.}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ end }} \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;{{ .Get \u0026quot;src\u0026quot; }}\u0026quot; {{ if or (.Get \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (.Get \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }}alt=\u0026quot;{{ with .Get \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;}}{{.}}{{else}}{{ .Get \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }}{{ end }}\u0026quot;{{ end }} /\u0026gt; {{ if .Get \u0026quot;link\u0026quot;}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;{{ end }} {{ if or (or (.Get \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (.Get \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (.Get \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} \u0026lt;figcaption\u0026gt;{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }} {{ .Get \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}{{ end }} {{ if or (.Get \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) (.Get \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}}\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; {{ .Get \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ with .Get \u0026quot;attrlink\u0026quot;}}\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{.}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ .Get \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; }} {{ if .Get \u0026quot;attrlink\u0026quot;}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/figcaption\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/figure\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- image --\u0026gt;  Usage I simply changed:\n{% image full http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4136/4829260124_57712e570a_o_d.jpg \u0026quot;One of my favorite touristy-type photos.

There are no hard and fast rules here except that hugo server --watch is your friend. Test your changes and fix errors as needed.\nClean up You\u0026rsquo;ll want to remove the Jekyll configuration at this point.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }}  Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }}  Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }}  Variables Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;  Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }}  Functions Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Includes When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }}  Logic Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Conditionals If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\n false 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero  Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}}  Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Pipes One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}  is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}  It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }}  Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Context (aka. the dot) The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n {{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026quot;Permalinks\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;2013-11-18\u0026quot; aliases: - \u0026quot;/doc/permalinks/\u0026quot; groups: [\u0026quot;extras\u0026quot;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n {{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Using Site (config) Parameters In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;text-center\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;author\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;/images/twitter.png\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026quot;recent\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/posts/hugoisforlovers/','title':"Getting Started with Hugo",'section':"Blog",'content':"Step 1.

In this session we\u0026rsquo;ll learn some basics of Python and Introduce ourselves to Machine Learning with Python. Python is THE go-to language for Machine Learning, and Data Sciences. This is because of the highly dynamic nature of python, which makes it very efficient to handle data. The language is also very intuitive, so one does not have to learn a lot of unnecessary syntax (such as brackets and semicolons). Another factor that has led to the popularity of Python is the large community. A large community means that platforms and libraries constantly grow, and bugs are solved very fast. A large community also offers support to beginners and professionals alike, which attracts them towards itself. Infact, Python has reached a point, where it is the only self-sufficient language to exist today, wiping all its competition in the past few years (such as R, Caffe, Java, etc).\nTo give you a deeper insight, a lot of frameworks have been developed on top of Python (meaning, a lot of libraries have been developed using Python, with the aim to make programmers\u0026rsquo; lives easier, so that they dont have to write the code from scratch). As you will see yourself, you can create a State-of-the-Art AI model that can differentiate between people (such as in a facial recognition system) or an object detection system (such as in a self-driving-car) in as few as 5 lines of Python code.\n#The Environment: Jupyter Notebooks\nThe platform on which this tutorial has been developed is called a Jupyter Notebook. Here, you can write python code very efficiently. However, you are not required to use Jupyter Notebooks, although it is recommended. If you are comfortable using text editors such as VSCode, vim or PyCharm, that works too. You can find a lot of online tutorials to work with text editors. Any text editor will work!\nThere are a few perks to using Jupyter Notebooks.\n It is highly interactive. You can see, how we can even write notes and text inside the same document as your code. If you come across a bug in the code, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to rerun the entire code. You can simply fix the bug and continue writing code. Whereas in a text editor, you need to compile and run the code everytime you make a change and wish to run it. You will learn more about it as you go through the code.  Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks We write Python code in cells, as you can see below.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve written a simple line of code that can print \u0026lsquo;Hello World\u0026rsquo;. Simply click on the code and run it. You can run it by either clicking the triangle on the left of the code, or pressing Shift + Enter\nprint('Hello World! This is a cell') Basics of Python Note 1: This is for those who are unfamiliar with Python and/or programming. If you are familiar with Python, you can skip this section. You can simply click on the small arrow besides the subheading to minimize or expand the entire subsection. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to view this subsection, for example, you can simply minimize it, and it will become easier for you to read. Note 2: The best way to learn any programming language is to learn over time. You should not try to learn the entire language before using it. The best way to learn is to learn through trial and error. So don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to make errors. The more you make errors, the more you will learn. Having said that, we won\u0026rsquo;t teach you everything in this notebook - infact, we\u0026rsquo;ll only give you the basic tools to get started. And over time, we will introduce you to concepts as and when required. And you will learn a lot of stuff on your own as well! Variables and Variable Types Let us introduce you to a variable in Python. A variable is a container which can contain any value, like a number, a string, a list of strings, or even other variables. There are no restrictions to what type of value a variable may contain in python, unlike some other programming languages, where you can only put certain types of values in a particular variable. For example, in the language C, a variable that is designed to contain numbers, cannot contain a string of characters.\nYou can name your variable anything. The only things to keep in mind are -\n the variables are case sensitive. For example, \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; are two different variable names in Python. The name of the variable cannot start with a number. You can have both letters and numbers. You can also have the underscore \u0026quot; _ \u0026quot; in your variable name anywhere. There are certain words that Python uses internally. You cannot name your variable as one of those words. A list of these words can be found here.  Let us define a variable. You can edit the code and write anything instead of the string \u0026lsquo;Python\u0026rsquo;. Try writing your name in place of \u0026lsquo;Python\u0026rsquo; (make sure your value is contained within quotes. In python, single quotes and double quotes mean the same thing).\nYou also see a hash sign in the code below, followed by a statement. This is a comment, and python ignores everything that is written in a line after a hash sign. It is for you, the user, to write your comments and understand the code better. We\u0026rsquo;ll be adding comments throughout the code for you to understand the code better.\nmy_variable = 'Python' print(my_variable) Now go back to the above cell (by using the up arrow key, and instead of your name, type a number (anything - a whole number, a decimal number, etc) and rerun the cell (using shift+enter ), and now the code prints that number. So you can see, the same variable can take any value, and any type of value - no restrictions.\nThis is a good time to introduce you to the types of values in Python. Infact, this is common to most of the programming languages, so it is a good piece of information to know. As for now, let us introduce ourselves to three types of values -\n  Numbers: These are the values on which you can do arithemetic operations on. Like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponential, negation, etc. Numbers can be either\n Integers (represented by int) (like, -1,0,1,2\u0026hellip;and so on) Floating point numbers (represented by float) (like -1.0, 0.0, 1.00002, etc)  These are all the numbers that you would need most of the times. But you can also have complex numbers (represented by complex. For example 1 + 3j is a valid number in python.\n  String: These are the values on which you cannot perform arithemetic operations on. They usually represent names of things. Like your name, the letters of the alphabet, and so on.\n  booleans: True and False are called boolean values. Its a method to check a condition. For example: is 2 greater than 1? The answer is True.\n  Any value that does not fit in these categories is called None type. It represents an empty variable. In better words, the memory block in your computer is empty, if I assign it the value None.\nLet us explore these data types\n#writing multiple print statements would write all the values on different lines\rprint(1)\rprint(1.000)\rprint(1 + 5)\rprint(1.0 + 5.0)\rprint(type(1), type(1.0)) # you can write multiple things inside a print command, and it will print both the objects side by side.\r# type(...) returns the type of the item inside it. So, it tells that 1 is an int, and 1.0 is a float! #Excercise: Try printing the sum of the first non-zero digits (Starting from 1). Write your code below this line\r#let us try it with variables\rvariable_1 = 5\rvariable_2 = 6\rprint(variable_1 + variable_2)\rprint(variable_1*variable_2)\rprint(-variable_1)\r#Exercise for you! Declare variable variable_3 with another value. Now show 2 different ways in which #shifting brackets gives different results (because of BODMAS). Write your code below.\r#strings\rvariable_1='Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'\rvariable_2='Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit'\rprint(type(variable_1))\r#you cant add two variables. For example 'a' + 'b' makes no absolute sense. But in Python, you can operate two strings with a '+' sign.\r#It doesnt add the two strings, but instead joins them (or in other words, concatenates them)\rprint(variable_1 + ' ' + variable_2) Lists Lists are one of the most frequently used concepts in python. Lists are basically a collection of values, that is given a seperate name. Lists are represented by [ ]. For example:\nmy_list = [10,20,30,40,50] # the list of numbers 1 through 5\rprint(my_list)\rprint(type(my_list)) Remember not to name your list as \u0026lsquo;list\u0026rsquo;, because \u0026lsquo;list\u0026rsquo; is a python keyword, that is reserved by the language.\nIn the context of Data Sciences, lists can be use to store all the data in one variable.\nYou can then isolate a particular element of the list. We do so by indexing, which is done by writing my_list[0] , for example. The zero is the index, which refers to the first element of the list, the value of which is 10, in this case.\nThe index can range from 0 to the number of elements in the list minus 1. This may be confusing at first - you may ask, why isnt the index simply from 1 to the number of elements in the list?! But that\u0026rsquo;s just how it is. Infact, this is used in many programming languages. An exception may be MATLAB.\nprint(my_list[0],my_list[1])\r#in addition to the range of the indices mentioned above, you can even write -1,-2 and so on. -1 simply means 'the last element of the list'\r#-2 would mean , the second last element and so on. print(my_list[-1]) Slicing the lists:\nYou can slice lists, which means, you can choose a subsection of the list, and store it in another variable. This is done using [ : index ], where index is the index till which you want your elements to be sampled, the element at that index excluded.\nsub_list=my_list[:3] #sub_list will contain values till index number 2 (thats the third element, because, remember? indexing starts from 0)\r#index number 3, and all subsequent values are excluded\rprint(sub_list) So in this method, you slice a list from the beginning. But you can also do from the end. So if we slice using [index_1:], we get a subsection, that contains values from index index_1 (included in this case), till the end\nsub_list_1 = my_list[3:] # we get values from index=3 till the end\rprint(sub_list_1) What if we want a subsection that is in the middle of the list (ie, does not contain either the end, or the beginning). We do so by [ index_1 : index_2 ] . As you may have guessed, we will get values from index_1 to index_2. index_1 WILL be included, but index_2 will not be included.\nOne way to memorize this is - imagine [ index_1 : index_2 ] as\n index_1 : + : index_2\n So, if you recall, index_1 : includes the index, while : index_2 excluded the index.\nsub_list_2=my_list[1:4]\rprint(sub_list_2) #the indices included are - 1,2,3 Lists can also contain strings, other variables, other lists and any other type of data. Infact, in a single list, all of these types of values can coexist\nmy_list_1 = [1,None,True,'hello',1.55]\rprint(my_list_1) # a list with different types of values Functions You would know what a function is, from high school, or even first year calculus.\n y = f(x)\nA function f takes an input x and returns an output y.\nwe can define a function in python using the keyword def.\ndef f(x): return x**2 What does this function do? First of all, notice the syntax of the function - it takes a value (say x). It returns x**2 (which means x to the power of 2, or x squared, in other words). The word return is the word which gives back the calculated value.\ny=f(5)\ry #Jupyter notebooks allow you to print the value of a variable without having to write print explicitly. #The only condition is, that you should write the name of the variable as the last piece of code in the cell. This is a comment,\r#so it doesnt count. But if you write any other code after the 'y', the y will not be printed unless you explicitly write print(y) Besides calculations, a function can do anything which may or may not needed to be returned. For example -\ndef f(x):\rprint('Hi, this function calculates the square of a number') #this is totally unrelated to the function, #but the function still carries it out\rreturn x**2 print(f(5)) #yes, you can put functions inside print. Infact, print itself is a function! #So the input to the print function is the output of the f function. How about a function with more than one inputs?\ndef add_two_variables(x1,x2):\rreturn x1+x2+1\rsum_of_two_variable = add_two_variables(3,4) #sum_of_two_variables is a variable, to which we assign the value of the output of the function\rsum_of_two_variable Everything we do, we will do in terms of functions. Right now, we\u0026rsquo;ve only written very short peices of code. But your functions can be very long too. So, functions are an efficient way to repeat a task multiple times, without having to write down the code again and again. It also helps you to understand the code better. Its a concise way to express code.\n# Exercise for you: write a function f that takes 2 numbers, and returns two outputs: the sum of the two numbers, and the quotient. #the function should also print a statement that prints the difference of the two numbers. The order of the numbers in the operations does not matter\r#eg: def f(x1,x2). #y1,y2=f(number1,number2). In python, division is done using the '/' sign. (eg, num1/num2) If else conditions What if you want to check a condition. Like, if you want to check if your variables value is greater than a number? This is how we check conditions.\nvariable_1=5 #try different values of the variable. But make sure the variable is a number. Because you cant compare a string with a number.\rif variable_1\u0026gt;3: print('yes, the value is greater than 3')\relse: print('no, the value is Less than 3') Also, try making the value of the variable - a string. You will get an error! Thats okay. As we mentioned - errors are the things that teach you, and make you a better programmer! Change the value again, and run it again!\nFYI, the else statement is optional. if you only write if \u0026lt;condition\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;action\u0026gt;, it is still correct. Else basically means, if the above condition is not met, do something. So obviously, if you dont write the else part: if the above condition is not met, do nothing!\n  At this point, let us introduce you to comparison operators. In the above code, we did an inequality comparison (Greater than/less than). Some other operators are:\n x==y To check if x and y are equal x!=y to check if x and y are NOT equal x \u0026gt; y to check if x is greater than y x \u0026lt; y to check if x is less than y x \u0026gt;= y to check if x is greater than or equal to y x \u0026lt;= y to check if x is lesser than or equal to y  # Exercise for you!\r# Write a FUNCTION, that takes in two strings! within the function, # assign a variable the value True if the two strings are the same, # and false otherwise. Return the value of this variable\rfor loops A loop literally means to do something again and again. So for example, we want to compute the square of numbers from 1 to 20, we can write a loop function, which runs again and again, taking different inputs everytime.\nThe syntax is as follows\ninputs=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]\rfor i in inputs: print(i**2) i is a dummy variable - meaning a temporary variable which takes the values of the elements in the inputs list. Its actually just like plain english. You can simply guess what for i in inputs means. For a number (which, lets call it i for the sake of simplicity) in the list called inputs, do something! Isnt that simple to understand?\nActually, if you simply want all the numbers within a range - there is this function in python, called range.\nrange(20) returns all the numbers from 0 to 19. If you want your numbers between a particular range, say 1 and 20, we would write range(1,21). You would have guessed! just like before, the first index is included, but the last index is not!\nSo instead of for i in inputs, you can write for i in range(1,21), and you will get the same results.\n#Excercise for you! Instead of directly writing what to do inside the for loop, write a function (outside of the for loop), and use the function inside the loop\r#Your task? write a function which only prints the value if the value is even. Hence, your function will have no return value. So you can skip that line.\r# so, for all the values in the given range (say 1 to 20): if a value is even: print the value, otherwise - do nothing.\rThat is all the basics you need for Python. As we said, we would introduce you to important concepts in python as we proceed. We encourage you to explore the language on your own - and learn. You can never learn enough! And don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes. There\u0026rsquo;s no mistake that cannot be corrected!\nOne another important piece of advice is - to not spend too much time remembering syntaxes. More often than not, you will have access to the internet, and you can simply go online and search for the syntax. Infact, you can also find the code others may have written - so it just makes life easier for you. Ofcourse, treat this as a learning opportunity, and not as an excuse to not learn at all. Because if you don\u0026rsquo;t know your language and concepts well - you would never be able to fully utilize your knowledge.\nAnd finally, the language itself is not knowledge. It is only a tool to gain knowledge and experience. You will use python to build Machine Learning models, and so, its only fair to think of it as a stepping ladder towards your goal!\nMachine Learning The Practical Meaning of Machine Learning You\u0026rsquo;ve seen in class how to define Machine Learning in theory. But what does Machine Learning mean in practice?\nMachine Learning is a fast evolving branch of study, which relates to, as the name suggests, make machines (computers) - \u0026ldquo;learn\u0026quot;, or \u0026ldquo;think\u0026rdquo; about information. If we can teach machines to \u0026ldquo;think\u0026rdquo;, it would certainly make our lives easier, since we don\u0026rsquo;t have to do the thinking.\nWe are surrounded by Machine Learning even in today\u0026rsquo;s world. You must have heard about glorified stories of self driving cars and self-aware robots, but we often overlook the ways in which Machine Learning already impacts our lives, in the most subtle ways possible. For example\u0026hellip;\n You don\u0026rsquo;t have to memorize directions anymore, because the Maps Application on your phone does that for you. Your GMail automatically sends spam email to the Spam section, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t let it appear in our inbox, so we don\u0026rsquo;t have to take the effort to do so. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to know the spelling of words to be able to type in today\u0026rsquo;s world. Your keyboard autocorrects any obvious mistakes, with what it thinks would best fit in the context. There are even companies based on this, like Grammarly. So, if you never thought about it, even though autocorrects may be annoying sometimes, its amazing how these systems are aware of the context of what you\u0026rsquo;re typing, and give you suggestions based on that.  Most modern phone keyboards also suggest next words based on context. They also learn your behaviours. For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re a person who uses a lot of emojis, the keyboard will learn when to suggest that you type emojis.\n  You don\u0026rsquo;t have to learn the local language of a place to be able to visit it. Google can translate between your language and the local language very efficiently, both ways. And its getting better day by day.\n  We dont need to take the effort to type anymore, we can simply say \u0026ldquo;Hey Google\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Hey Siri\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Hey Alexa\u0026rdquo; (depending on the device you have) and ask it to do something for you. And not just petty tasks, you can even ask it to do important tasks, like paying your bills, place orders, book appointments, etc. It even does not matter if you speak in a different accent, or even if you stutter, fumble or there\u0026rsquo;s noise in the background.\n  Do you observe a pattern in all the highlighted words? You would observe that all these reflect the idea of gathering knowledge about different things. We have somehow been able to teach Machines to think and do tasks for us, so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to do them. The ultimate goal of Machine Learning is to be able to teach machines to do tasks that we do everyday, so that humans can focus on more intellectual tasks.\nThis is why AI and automation are called the 4th Industrial Revolution (The first three being The Steam Engine (1768\u0026rsquo;s), Oil and Electricity (and hence the Industrialization that followed)(1850\u0026rsquo;s),and Computerization (1970\u0026rsquo;s))\nIf you think about it, there\u0026rsquo;s a reason that each of these is called an Industrial Revolution. The Revolution refers to a change in the goals of development of the entire humanity.\nFor example, Before the steam engine, Trade was only limited to local communities, because travel was simply impossible over long routes. We developed as a species when travel became fast with the steam engine. Travel times were cut massively, which implied faster development.\nWith The second Industrial Revolution, production of goods became fast and cheap. Humans did not have to hand-produce essential goods. We developed as a race, because humans could now focus on more important and intellectual things, like development of Technology, Economy, Politics, etc.\nWith the third Industrial Revolution, We discovered how to make computers do the tasks that we did everyday. Computers could now handle Computation, Information Processing, and information storage. Communication Systems also improved. And the Internet emerged too! Just 20 years ago, there were no cell phones widely available. Today, we have highly evolved platforms to communicate - over Calls, Social Media, the \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; media, like theTelevision, etc. This has not only helped us connect better, but allowed us to work on even more intellectual tasks, such as Research, both Scientific and Social, Large Scale Global Trade, Space Exploration, Global Economy, etc.\nWhat AI and autonimity will allow us to do, is to focus on even more intellectual tasks, by doing the everyday cognitive tasks for us. If we can save the time and energy to do these everyday tasks, we can, as a collective human race, focus on more important tasks.\n But How do you make Machines Learn? Machines are not hard-coded to gather knowledge. Infact, that is simply not possible. No human can write a computer program that can differentiate between two different faces. We ourselves do not know how to represent such a task using an algorithm. Its just something we \u0026lsquo;know\u0026rsquo; how to do.\nThe way machines learn to do such tasks is through identifying patterns in the Data we provide to it. That is the gist of all of Machine Learning. And all of the theory of Machine Learning is to simply develop algorithms that can learn information about the data. In the image below, you can see, how we feed data into the system. The system combines all this information to get meaningful results.\nFor example, if our model was to differentiate between two different people, we would \u0026ldquo;train\u0026rdquo; our Machine Learning model over a collection of pictures of these two people (the data), to learn features that diffentiate the two people. For example, the model may learn that one person is of different skin tone than the other, or one has a particular hairstyle, which is different from the other person\u0026rsquo;s hairstyle.\nWhat is a Machine Learning Model? A Machine Learning Model is the entity which gives us meaningful results. It is, at core, a mathematical function, which takes in data as the input and gives us results as the ouput. For example, the images of two people are the inputs, and the classification of whether the picture is of person A or B, is the result.\nDeveloping our own Machine Learning models. Let us build our own Machine Learning Models. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about Machine Learning, thats okay - We provide you with all the necessary tools. The idea behind this is to motivate you towards Machine Learning, and to help you understand the extent of applications of Machine Learning. This is also to tell you that, Machine Learning is not black magic! And it does not require one to have a PhD degree or years of experience to dive into Machine Learning. You might not be able to understand how it works in total depth, but it certainly does not need a lot of knowledge to run your models.\nThis approach is called the top-down approach of learning, and this is how all of coding should be learnt. We learn how to use applications first, and then learn the details gradually, rather than the other way round. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of Machine Learning beginners simply lose interest in Machine Learning when they\u0026rsquo;re overloaded with a lot of theory, without getting the opportunity to utilize the knowledge. We all like to assure ourselves that all the effort of learning is worth it. So, while you will learn a lot of theory in lectures, these labs will give you the tools to apply your knowledge in the real world. And we assure you, you won\u0026rsquo;t build dummy models, but actual state-of-the-art models.\nYour first Machine Learning Model Let us begin by creating a model that will tell you which breed a cat or a dog belongs to, just by looking at an image of a cat or a dog. Before that, let us install the necessary library. For this particular problem, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using a library called fastai, which is a widely used library for deep learning, and makes it possible to train models efficiently without having to go in a lot of details of the code.\nWhat is Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, and is probably the most famous type of Machine Learning. If you decide to pursue Machine Learning in greater depth outside this course, you will find yourself almost predominantly exploring Deep Learning. It uses something known as Neural Networks as models (remember, a model is nothing but a mathematical function which maps the input to the output). The reason it is so famous, is because of the great flexibility that Neural Networks provide. They can solve any complexity of problems easily. We\u0026rsquo;ll learn more about Deep Learning as the course proceeds. The idea, at this point, is to simply let you know about what Machine Learning is about in the practical world.\nBy the way, this is what a Neural Network looks like. You may or may not have seen this image before.\nLet us begin by installing the fastai library. Before that, you need to enable your GPU. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Colab, all you need to do is click on Runtime on the top, then Change Runtime Type, and change the Hardware Accelerator from None to GPU.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using a PC instead of Colab, check if your PC has a GPU, that is CUDA enabled.\nIf it seems a little intimidating at first, don\u0026rsquo;t worry. Remember, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to learn all these technicalities at this stage. We will learn of all these technicalities as we proceed in the course. Right now, we are only introducing you to what Machine Learning looks like.\nDisclaimer: Before We start, Please keep in mind. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to memorize/and or understand the code per se. Ofcourse, if you can figure it out - great!. If you cannot, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. We only ask you to appreciate the beauty of Machine Learning.\n!pip install fastai --upgrade \u0026gt;.tmp\rfrom fastai.vision.all import * We will now download the dataset called Oxford-IIIT Pets, which contains 37 different categories of breeds of cats and dogs.\npath = untar_data(URLs.PETS) # this peice of code downloads the data from the internet, #unzips all the files, and also tells us that our data is #stored at a location which we store in the variable named path\rpath The data is stored in the location that is written just above this line, the name of which we temporarily store in the variable named path. Let us now visualize this dataset.\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_re(path, get_image_files(path/'images'), pat=r'^(.*)_\\d+.jpg', item_tfms=Resize(224))\rdls.show_batch() You can see different breeds of cats or dogs, with their breed written on top of the corresponding image. So Now that our dataset is ready, lets jump into training our model! It will take about 5 minutes to train our state-of-the-art Pet breed classifier.\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)\rlearn.fine_tune(4,3e-3) There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of jargon here, like epoch and train_loss. Let us skip all these details for now. Basically, a Neural Network is trained in stages, and it keeps getting better and better each stage. Focus on the column that says accuracy - which tells us how good the model is performing at each of these stages.\nThe final value of the column tells us the accuracy of your model - basically, out of all the pictures, how many times does the model identify the breed of the cat or dog correctly. Your model gets the breed right for than 90% of the time. How amazing is that?!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s even more amazing is to imagine what the model must have learned. To identify one breed from another, it must have to identify the colour, fur texture, fluffiness, proportions, facial features, size, and a lot of other things, which our human brains can identify effortlessly, and which we take for granted. Our brain truly is amazing.\nNow for the most exciting part! Let\u0026rsquo;s try this out on our own very picture. If you have a photo of a dog or a cat on your PC, upload it using the button that appears after you run the code in the cell below. Again, the code won\u0026rsquo;t make sense to you. We don\u0026rsquo;t expect you to understand right now either!\nfrom fastai.vision.widgets import *\rbtn_upload=widgets.FileUpload()\rbtn_upload #this is your image!\rimg = PILImage.create(btn_upload.data[-1])\rimg Note: If you\u0026rsquo;re running your code on a text editor on your local PC: you don\u0026rsquo;t have to use this upload widget. You can simply enter the absolute path of the image by writing the code:\npath=Path('\u0026lt;write absolute path of the image here\u0026gt;')\rimg=PILImage.open(path)\rAnd let\u0026rsquo;s see what the model think this is!\npred=learn.predict(img)[0]\ris_cat=' cat' if pred[0].isupper() else ' dog'\rpred + is_cat A lot of you must have uploaded a picture of something which is neither a cat nor a dog. And found out, that the model still predicts it to be one of the breeds of a cat or dog. Turns out the model is not as smart as our human brain! But we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss the reason in depth when we cover Neural Networks.\nHaving said that, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried uploading a picture of something which is neither a cat or dog, do so! Why not?\nInfact, here\u0026rsquo;s a fun experiment. You must know that not every dog or cat is suitable for everyone. A person fits best with a pet that has the same traits as the person, and same \u0026lsquo;spirit\u0026rsquo; as the person. And a lot of times, the owners and pets even LOOK alike.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s find yours! Go back to the upload button above, click a selfie and upload your photo. And run the code below it. You will get a prediction of a cat or a dog breed! That\u0026rsquo;s your spirit animal.\nOfcourse, it may not be true. But its worth looking into. Who knows you start liking that breed more now!\nSummary We introduced ourselves to python, and Machine Learning as a broad area of study. We studied the basics of Python and learned some important concepts that are essential for Machine Learning, and Data Sciences in general. We learned what Machine Learning means in the practical world, and how it has evolved to impact our lives for good. And we even built our first Machine Learning model, and experimented with it.\nIn the next lab, we\u0026rsquo;ll look into Linear and Logisitic Regression!\n"});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/docs/example/collapsed/3rd-level/4th-level/','title':"4th Level",'section':"3rd Level",'content':"4th Level of Menu Caesorum illa tu sentit micat vestes papyriferi Inde aderam facti; Theseus vis de tauri illa peream.
